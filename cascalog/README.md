Cascalog Demo
==============

This project provides some simple examples of Cascalog, a Clojure-based framework which builds on Cascading. It borrows some example WordCount code from the excellent *Cascalog for the Impatient* series, which provides much more content here: https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient-Cascalog/wiki. The main changes made here are to support the latest version of Cascalog and Cascading, as well as Hadoop 2.x.
